# React Native with React Navigation and Redux Example

Initial setup:
expo init (go through prompts)

Why do all React Navigation expo snack examples have react-navigation 3.x when docs say to install the pkgs below?
expo install react-navigation react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
expo install react-redux redux 
expo install react-navigation-stack
yarn add @react-navtive-community/masked-view
